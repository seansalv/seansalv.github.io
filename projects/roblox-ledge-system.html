      <h1>Ledge Grabbing &amp; Climbing System (Roblox)</h1>
      <p class="project-intro">
        This system handles ledge detection, grabbing, and climbing using Roblox Lua.
        It supports different ledge heights, windows, and blockers while keeping
        movement smooth and responsive. It also includes a wall-climbing variant
        with a decay mechanic to limit how long the player can stay on a surface.
      </p>

        <h2>Wall Climbing with Decay</h2>
        <p>
          Shows the wall-climbing behavior with a decay mechanic that gradually reduces
          climb time. This prevents infinite wall-cling and makes the system feel more
          skill-based and tunable.

        <h2>Ledge Vaulting Demo</h2>
        <p>
          Demonstrates vaulting over different ledge heights, including short vaults,
          full climbs, and handling of awkward edge positions where the player should
          not snap or jitter.

        <h2>What’s Implemented</h2>
        <ul class="feature-list">
          <li>Ledge detection via forward and downward raycasts to find valid grab points.</li>
          <li>Finite state machine for idle, grab, climb, vault, wall-climb, and drop states.</li>
          <li>Configurable rules for windows, blockers, and invalid ledges.</li>
          <li>Animation hooks and event points for syncing movement with character animations.</li>
          <li>Decay-based timer to control how long players can cling to walls.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="details-section">
        <h2>Tech &amp; Concepts</h2>
        <p>
          Roblox Lua, raycasting, state machines, character movement manipulation,
          animation events, and parameterized tuning for gameplay feel (ledge distance,
          raycast length, decay rate, and climb speeds).
